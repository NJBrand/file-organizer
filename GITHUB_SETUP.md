# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to push your File Organizer and Cleaner project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "file-organizer-cleaner")
4. Add a short description: "A Python application to clean and organize files on your computer"
5. Keep the repository Public (or select Private if you prefer)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we've already created these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Use the following commands in your PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
# Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer-cleaner.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub page
2. You should now see all your project files uploaded to GitHub
3. The README.md will be displayed on the main page

## 4. Additional GitHub Features to Consider

- **Issues**: Enable Issues to track bugs and feature requests
- **Projects**: Create a project board to track development progress
- **Wiki**: Add detailed documentation for your project
- **Actions**: Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing

## 5. Sharing Your Repository

To share your File Organizer and Cleaner with others:

1. Make sure your repository is set to Public
2. Copy the URL from your browser (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer-cleaner)
3. Share this URL with others

## 6. Continued Development

After pushing to GitHub, you can continue working on your project:

1. Make changes to your files locally
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "Description of changes"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

Happy coding!
